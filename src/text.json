    "about": "Welcome! I am a computer science undergraduate concentrating in ML and computer systems at Carnegie Mellon University. From an inner perspective, I am very technically-detailed, trying to prevent mistakes before they occur and attempting to understand the meticulous subtleties of any system.  In my free time, I enjoy the outdoors, running for CMU, and developing this website as a fun side project. As this website grows, I will (may) add past personal projects, intern projects, and anything cool from school (sidenote: this is also an attempt to learn React) "
